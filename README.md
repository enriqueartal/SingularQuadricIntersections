# SingularQuadricIntersections

In the work *On generic singularities of intersections of ellipsoids: the octahedron*, with Santiago López de Medrano and María Teresa Lozano Imízcoz,
[arXiv:2403.20286](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20286), we study some properties of intersections of ellipsoids with singularities, specially in dimension $3$. Some of these properties require some computational help, which can be checked with the notebooks in this repository.

Run [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/enriqueartal/SingularQuadricIntersections/main) to execute the notebooks.
