# SingularQuadricIntersections

In the work in progress *On generic singularities of intersections of ellipsoids: the octahedron*, with Santiago López de Medrano and María Teresa Lozano Imízcoz, we study some properties of intersections of ellipsoids with singularities, specially in dimension $3$. Some of these properties require some computational help, which can be checked with the notebooks in this repository.
